# Level 1Open: Hiya, I'm Toad the wise ol' frog, here to help you through loan facts! Auto Loans? Yup, those help you buy new or used cars! Student Loans? Not everyone can get one, they've got rules, for example, you can't get them if you are not a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. Mortgage Loans? You bet they help buy houses, they will never be used to help with renting a place! Personal Loans? Oh, they can cover things like medical bills, Debt consolidation, even Vacations. And yep, Credit Cards are sneaky little loans in disguise meaning you will have to pay them back eventually!Right: *Ribbit Ribbit* Credit, debit, and prepaid cards all work in different ways but each lets you pay for things or manage your money. Wrong: Did a fly get in your eye tadpole?# Level 3Open: Well, well, well, I'm the Caterpillar, here to graciously set you straight! The Simple Interest formula? Yeah, it's Interest = Principal ? Rate ? Time nothing special. Guess what? Simple interest doesn't grow each year, it stays the same so don't worry about that. APRs? Those numbers will tell you what you're really paying, including not just interest, but fees too, all put into a yearly percentage. Fixed-rate loans? They do keep their interest rate steady, unlike your last relationship. But variable-rate loans? Their rates definitely change over time just like you. Got it?Right: Now we are morphing into a finance guru! Wrong: I guess its not that simple for you!# Level 4Open: Look who leaped into the dark! I'm the Firefly, we'll see if you can keep up. First off, secured loans with no collateral? Ha! Don't make me laugh, if only that it was true. Unsecured loans? Sneaky as a dragonfly, they love to stuff higher interest rates into those loans. Are you a co-signer? Tough luck if they bail, you get stuck with the bill. Paying just the minimum each month? May as well set fire to your dollars, paying more will get rid of the interest faster. You can take out more than one loan,but it's not the wisest decision however; knowledge keeps you out of the dark.Right: Your seeing the knowledge now!Wrong: It's dark out again!# Level 2	Open: I'm Ms. LadyBug, When it comes to managing money, it's important to know how different accounts and cards work. Checking accounts often require you to keep a minimum balance, or the bank might charge a fee. Closing a credit card can lower your overall available credit, which might drop your credit score. You can quickly improve your credit score with credit cards, don't just pay the minimum balance, you'll still be in debt. Debit cards are great for spending your own money, but they won't help build credit. Prepaid cards can be convenient, but some come with monthly or reload fees.Right: I see you have been listening! Wrong: you need to think again.# Level 5Open: Hello I'm the Dragonfly. Make sure to remember the rules, tips, and info we talked about. Credit cards can be really helpful for building a credit score, which shows that you're responsible with money and can make it easier to get loans, mortgages, or rentals in the future. Many creatures use them to make big purchases and slowly pay it off. Now, prepaid cards are also great for those who want to control their spending. Then lastly, checking accounts are best for everyday spending, while savings accounts are designed for saving money and earn interest over time.Right: Nice to see some growth in you.Wrong: And its gone!# Level 6 (Pray Mantis)Open: You know everything you need for this final level.Right: I know you got this!Wrong: You better get back to the books.
